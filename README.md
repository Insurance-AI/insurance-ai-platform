# 🧠 InsurIQ - AI-Powered Insurance Recommendation Platform

> Empowering users with intelligent, data-driven insurance decisions.

## 🔍 Overview

Millions of users unknowingly purchase insurance policies based on biased or uninformed recommendations by agents. **InsurIQ** is here to change that.  
Our platform helps users **understand, analyze, and choose the right insurance** based on real-life data — **transaction history, bank statements, UPI activity**, and **personal financial habits**.

No more guesswork. No more manipulation. Just smart insurance decisions.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔎 **Personalized Insurance Recommendation**  
  Upload your bank statement or UPI transaction history — InsurIQ analyzes it to recommend **exactly which type of insurance** (life, health, travel, car, credit) you need.

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Analysis & Prediction**  
  Using advanced ML models, we analyze:
  - Spending patterns
  - Income levels
  - Lifestyle indicators  
  ...to suggest which **life insurance plan** is best for you — with **maximum benefits and minimal cost**.

- 📊 **Risk & Benefit Analysis**  
  Know your **risk profile** and **benefit probability** from a given insurance plan before you invest.

- 🔗 **Future Integration with UPI/Banking APIs**  
  In future versions, we aim to support:
  - Direct integration with GPay and other UPI apps
  - Bank account linking for real-time data
  - Smart alerts and recommendations

- 🔍 **Insurance Market Trends (Coming Soon)**  
  Our models learn from macro data and user behavior to predict what most people with similar profiles are buying and benefiting from.
